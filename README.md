# Implementation

This script requires the sortedcontainers==1.5.7 python package, please install by running install.sh or just use pip or pip3. 
The original design is to use Python3, but later I made it Python2 compatible as well for it to be able to port to more potential environments

### Feature 1 
List in descending order the top 10 most active hosts/IP addresses that have accessed the site.

I used a hash table for frequently occurring hosts and a few sets to store infrequent ones 

### Feature 2 
Identify the top 10 resources on the site that consume the most bandwidth. Bandwidth consumption can be extrapolated from bytes sent over the network and the frequency by which they were accessed.

I used a simple defaultdict counter

### Feature 3 
List in descending order the siteâ€™s 10 busiest (i.e. most frequently visited) 60-minute period.

My implementation is not as fast as I would like it to be. It iterates over every second. 

### Feature 4 
Your final task is to detect patterns of three consecutive failed login attempts over 20 seconds in order to block all further attempts to reach the site from the same IP address for the next 5 minutes. Each attempt that would have been blocked should be written to a log file named `blocked.txt`.
